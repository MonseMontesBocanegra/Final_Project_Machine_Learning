# Final_Project_Machine_Learning

## Project Overview:
This project evaluates three machine learning paradigms—Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naïve Bayes Classifiers—for recognizing handwritten digits and alphabet characters. The project uses publicly available datasets (MNIST for digits and EMNIST for alphabets) to compare the performance of these models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to identify which machine learning model provides the best performance for handwritten character recognition, and explore real-world applications such as grading, form processing, and warehouse automation.

## Datasets Used
- MNIST Dataset: Handwritten digits (0-9)
- EMNIST Dataset: Handwritten alphabet characters (A-Z)

## Models Implemented
**Neural Network (NN):**  A fully connected network with 784 input neurons, two hidden layers, and an output layer with 10 neurons.
**Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Linear kernel SVM for digit and alphabet classification.
**Naïve Bayes Classifier:** A probabilistic classifier using Gaussian distribution for both datasets.

## Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

Confusion matrices and performance metrics are displayed for evaluation.
